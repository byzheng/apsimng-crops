The results are un-published to date.\nFour cultivars of Barley (‘Omaka’, ‘Dash’, ‘Sherwood’ and ‘Booma’) were sown on the 1st of October 2009 in a randomised complete block design with 4 replicates and two other factors, Irrigation and Nitrogen. The irrigation treatments consisted of full irrigation (to replace measured evapotranspiration) or nil irrigation (recieving only rainfall). The nitrogen treatments were 150 kg N broadcast in the early vegetative stage or nil fertiliser.\nBiomass accumulation, organ N content, Leaf area index, radiation interception and soil water content were measured at regular frequencies throughout the experiment."

The plots below show the observed vs predicted values for different traits. Each point represents an observation from an experiment. The closer the points are to the diagonal line, the better the performance of the model for that trait.\nThe range of observed and predicted values are estimated using data in this page, which may be misleading for the narrow ranges of observed and predicted values.\nUsing the Expand All and Collapse All buttons below, you can expand or collapse the sections for each trait to see the observed vs predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\nExpand All\n\n\nCollapse All\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteAboveGround.Wt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteEar.N\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteEar.NConc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteEar.Wt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteGrain.NConc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteGrain.Number\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteGrain.Size\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteGrain.Wt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteLeaf.CoverGreen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteLeaf.CoverTotal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteLeaf.Dead.Wt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteLeaf.LAI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteLeaf.Live.N\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteLeaf.Live.NConc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteLeaf.Live.Wt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteLeaf.SpecificAreaCanopy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteLeaf.Wt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSpike.Wt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteStem.N\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteStem.NConc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteStem.Wt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserved vs Predicted plots for different traits."
